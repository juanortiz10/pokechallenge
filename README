This repository has been created from this one: 
https://github.com/juanortiz10/react-redux-saga-router-skeleton 
which includes redux + saga + router + axios already configured.

It works basically getting the pokemons from a public api (https://pokeapi.co/), 
then, they are shown in a list where users can click over each one to see the pokemon detail. 
It also includes paging to see the previous/next 20 pokemons.

I used Material UI for styling and basic animations were included with Animate.CSS

Basic testing was added with Jest + Enzyme.
